# React and Forms

## Controlled Components

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- In HTML, form elements such as < input>, < textarea>, and < select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

- We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?

- should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them ,because we need to updata the state dynamic not in static way.

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

- A ternary operator allows you to assign one value to the variable if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false. ... A ternary operator makes the assignment of a value to a variable easier to see, because it's contained on a single line instead of an if else block.

‏## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement

```bash
 if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
```

## ternary statement

```bash
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
```
