# Read: 04 - OOP

## Objects

- An object is a software bundle od related state and behavior . software objects are often used in model real world objects that you find in everyday life


## Classes: 
 - is a blueprint or prototype from which object are created . it intentionally focuses on the basics , showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

### Declaring Classes:

- The preceding class declaration is a minimal one. It contains only those components of a class declaration that are required.

  ```java

  class MyClass {
      // field, constructor, and
      // method declarations
  }

  ```
### Providing Constructors for Your Classes

- A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarationsâ€”except that they use the name of the class and have no return type. For example, Bicycle has one constructor:

```java

public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
    gear = startGear;
    cadence = startCadence;
    speed = startSpeed;
}
```


# Decimals 
How do Decimal Numbers work? 
Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which:

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9


# Binary Numbers
Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1. 


# Hexadecimal Numbers
Hexadecimal numbers are interesting. There are 16 of them!

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10 like this:

| Decimal: |	0 |	1 |	2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 |	10 |	11 |	12 |	13 |	14 |	15 |
|----------|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Hexadecimal: |	0 |	1 |	2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 |	A |	B |	C |	D |	E |	F |
