# Implementation: Linked Lists

## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

- Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job.

- Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. 

## complexity:

- time: O(n) (worse case) the node which has the value that searches for it is last.

- space: O(1) This because there is no additional space being used.


## Linked Lists:

>A Linked List is a type of data structure contains a sequence of Nodes that are linked to each other.

## Type of Linked Lists:

> Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has.

## Content Of Linked Lists:

**Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.**

- Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

- Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

- Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. 

**When looping threw the linked list The best is to use use while loop, We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing.**
