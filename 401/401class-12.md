# Read: 12 - Spring RESTful Routing & Static Files

## @RequestMapping Basics

### @RequestMapping — by Path

- define the Request URI to access the REST Endpoints
- @RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET)

### @RequestMapping — the HTTP Method

- The HTTP method parameter has no default
- @RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = POST)
  @ResponseBody

## RequestMapping and HTTP Headers

### @RequestMapping With the headers Attribute

- The mapping can be narrowed even further by specifying a header for the request:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", headers = "key=val", method = GET)
  @ResponseBody
```

### @RequestMapping Consumes and Produce

```java
@RequestMapping(
  value = "/ex/foos",
  method = GET,
  headers = "Accept=application/json")
  @ResponseBody
```

### RequestMapping With Path Variables

- Parts of the mapping URI can be bound to variables via the `@PathVariable` annotation.
- `Single @PathVariable`
- `Multiple @PathVariable`
-` @PathVariable With Regex`

### RequestMapping With Request Parameters

- allows easy mapping of URL parameters with the `@RequestParam` annotation.


### Baeldung: Comparing repositories
* Spring Data Repositories
  - CrudRepository - provides CRUD functions
  - PagingAndSortingRepository - provides methods to do pagination and sort records
  - JpaRepository - provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch, and contains the full API of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository due to their inheritance relationship
* CrudRepository -  CRUD functionality:
  - save(…) – save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
  - findOne(…) – get a single entity based on passed primary key value
  - findAll() – get an Iterable of all available entities in database
  - count() – return the count of total entities in a table
  - delete(…) – delete an entity based on the passed object
  - exists(…) – verify if an entity exists based on the passed primary key value
* PagingAndSortingRepository - extends CrudRepository, provides a method, and you cancreate an object with certain properties.
* JpaRepository methods:
  - indAll() – get a List of all available entities in database
  - findAll(…) – get a List of all available entities and sort them using the provided condition
  - save(…) – save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
  - flush() – flush all pending task to the database
  - saveAndFlush(…) – save the entity and flush changes immediately
  - deleteInBatch(…) – delete an Iterable of entities
