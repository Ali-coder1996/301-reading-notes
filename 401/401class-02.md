# Packages and Import

- Package = directory. Java classes can be grouped together in packages. A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files. You declare packages when you define your Java program, and you name the packages you want to use from other libraries in an import statement.

## Package declaration syntax

>The statement order is as follows. Comments can go anywhere.

1- Package statment (optional).

2- Imports (optional).

3- Class or interface definitions.

```bash
    package illustration;

    import java.awt.*;

    public class Drawing {
        . . .
}
```

## Arrays & Loops

- An array in Java is a set of variables referenced by using a single variable name combined with an index number. Each item of an array is an element. All the elements in an array must be of the same type.

```bash
    int[] array1;   // an array of int elements
    int array2[];   // another array of int elements
```

- Declaring an array doesnâ€™t actually create the array. To do that, you must use the new keyword, followed by the array type. For example.

```bash
    String[] names;
    names = new String[10];
```

```bash
    String[] names = new String[10];
```

- Loops in Java

> For Loops

**A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.**

>While Loops

**The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.**

> do while Loops

**The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.**

**Enhanced for-each loop.**
