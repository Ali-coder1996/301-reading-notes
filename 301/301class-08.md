1-What does REST stand for?

- REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

2-REST APIs are designed around a  kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client..

3-What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

```bash
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
```

```bash
{"orderId":1,"orderValue":99.90,"productId":1,"quantity":1}
```

4-What are the most common HTTP verbs?

- The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5-What should the URIs be based on?

-URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

6-Give an example of a good URI.

```bash
https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid
```

7-What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

- The more requests, the bigger the load. Therefore, try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources. Such an API may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires. Instead, you might want to denormalize the data and combine related information into bigger resources that can be retrieved with a single request....bad

8-What status code does a successful GET request return?

- A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).

9-What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

- If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

10-What status code does a successful POST request return?

- If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.

11-What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

- If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
