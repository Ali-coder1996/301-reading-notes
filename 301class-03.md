# Passing Functions as Props

1- What does .map() return?

- map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the
given function to each item.

2- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

- The map() method is the most commonly used function to iterate over an array of data in JSX. You can attach the map() method to the array and pass a callback function that gets called for each iteration. When rendering the User component, pass a unique value to the key prop.

3- Each list item needs a unique key .

4- What is the purpose of a key?

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

## spread operator

5- What is the spread operator?

-The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

In JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

6- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

- Using an array as arguments.

- Adding an item to a list.

- Adding to state in React.

- Combining objects.

7- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```bash
[...["😋😛😜🤪😝"]] // Array [ "😋😛😜🤪😝" ]
[..."🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"] // Array(9) [ "🙂", "🙃", "😉", "😊", "😇", "🥰", "😍", "🤩", "!" ]

const hello = {hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝"}
const world = {world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"}

const helloWorld = {...hello,...world}
console.log(helloWorld) // Object { hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝", world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!" }
```

8- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```bash
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
```

9- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```bash

const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

10- In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

- using the props to pass a data between the component

11- In your own words, what does the increment function do?

- increase the value of the Item by one or or higher than one

12- How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

1- Create a callback function in the parent component. This callback function will get the data from the child component.

2- Pass the callback function in the parent as a prop to the child component.

3- The child component calls the parent callback function using props.

13- How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

-The standard way of doing this is to have the parent pass a function to the child through props. The child then calls this function at some point and passes it a value that the parent is supposed to react to.
